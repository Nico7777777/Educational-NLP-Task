comment 1 : Here my very bad intuition . Please don't cuss me . I am new to linked List. We can use get the length of the Linked list . Then we create another function in which we create another array of size n(which is the size of linked list) and use HashMap to check frequency of the elements in the array . If the frequency of element is 1 . Modify the array . Then in main function . Just add the elements of array in linked list .
I know my solution is very bad but its my first intuition when i saw this question .

comment 1 : Consider using two distinct passes through the list to first identify and then remove duplicates. In the first pass, utilize a set to track all encountered values, marking duplicates as you go. This will allow you to identify which values occur more than once without altering the list structure. In the second pass, armed with the knowledge of which values are duplicates, traverse the list once more, this time removing nodes with values that appear in your duplicates set. Remember, the use of a dummy node can greatly simplify handling edge cases, especially when the head of the list might be removed. This approach leverages the efficiency of set operations and the simplicity of sequential traversal to achieve a clean, duplicate-free list.
